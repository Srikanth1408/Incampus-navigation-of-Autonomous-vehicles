# Incampus-navigation-of-Autonomous-vehicles


The project I have been working on as a part of my Master's thesis is In campus-navigation-of-Autonomous-vehicles. As a part of this project, I worked on the Autonomous shuttle's perception, planning, and control. In perception, I implemented Obstacle detection (Pothole detection). Along with the latter algorithm, other detection algorithms are integrated with the edge computing device NVIDIA AGX Orin, which sits as the computational board on the vehicle. In planning and controlling the vehicle, waypoint navigation was set as an algorithmic part, and MicroAuto Box 3 was set up, which serves as a low-level controller. I was guided by my postdoctorate throughout the process.
