# Incampus-navigation-of-Autonomous-vehicles

The project I have been working on as a part of my Master's thesis is In campus-navigation-of-Autonomous-vehicles. As a part of this project, I worked on the Autonomous shuttle's perception, planning, and control. In perception, I implemented Obstacle detection (Pothole detection). Along with the latter algorithm, other detection algorithms are integrated with the edge computing device NVIDIA AGX Orin, which sits as the computational board on the vehicle. In planning and controlling the vehicle, waypoint navigation was set as an algorithmic part, and MicroAuto Box 3 was set up, which serves as a low-level controller. I was guided by my postdoctorate throughout the process.


# Perception

POTHOLE DETECTION USING DEEP LEARNING
Deep learning is vital in solving perception-based problems in an Autonomous vehicle. Pothole detection is one of such serious problems to be dealt with in the Indian context. Deep learning models such as FRCNN and YOLOv5 are implemented to detect these potholes.
Now working on depth guided Transformer based models too, This model would predict the depth along with detection boxes parallely.
