# Incampus-navigation-of-Autonomous-vehicles

The project on which I have been working on as a part of my Maters thesis is Incampus-navigation-of-Autonomous-vehicles. 
As a part of this project I worked on Autonomous shuttle's perception, planning, and control. In perception, I implemented Obstacle detection (Pothole detection). 
Along with the later algorithm other detection algorithms are integrated with edge computing device NVIDIA AGX Orin, which sits as the computational board on the vehicle. 
In planning and control of the vehicle, waypoint navigation was setip as algorithmic part and MicroAuto Box 3 was setup, which serves as low level controller.
I was guided by my postdoctorate over the process.
